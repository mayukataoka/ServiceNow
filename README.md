# Sample login code using Appium and Python

## Test app 
I am using an Android fasion app called called Poshmark.  You can buy and sell your fashion items in your house. 

## Project structure 

-  screens directory (Contains page objects. I separated out locators into a different file.)
-  tests directory  (Contains different tests. The tests uses screens. )
-  helpers directory (Contains constants.  Values can be reassigned when needed)
-  data directory (Contains data)
-  api directory (I did not use api today. But I usually make api calls from my Appium tests to reset state or to verify data. )
